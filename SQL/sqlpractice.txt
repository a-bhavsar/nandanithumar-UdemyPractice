Q.1 STUDENT NAME WHERE TEACHER PHONE NO IS NOT NULL


Select name from student  where stu_id IN ( select stu_id from stu_sub where sub_id IN (select sub_id from teacher_subject where teacher_id IN (select teacher_id from teacher where phone_no is NOT NULL)));






Q.2 STUDENT NAME WHERE SUBJECT NAME = MATHS


Select student.name from stu_sub
Join student on stu_sub.stu_id=student.stu_id
Join subject on stu_sub.sub_id=subject.sub_id
Where subject.name=”mathematics”;






Q.3 CREATE PRIMARY KEY FOR SUB_TEACHER TABLE


PRIMARY KEY (sub_id,teacher_id),


Q.4 SUPPOSE WE FORGOT TO ADD PRIMARY KEY IN TABLE AND NOW THEY HAVE DUPLICATE ENTRY HOW WE CAN FIX DATA OF THAT TABLE.


–TO DELETE ALL DUPLICATES FROM OUR DATA
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE (id) IN (
SELECT DISTINCT id FROM table_name
GROUP BY id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);


–DELETE ALL DUPLICATE BUT ONE IS STILL IN DATABASE
WITH duplicate AS (
SELECT  col1,col2 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY col1,col2  ORDER BY col1) as row_num
FROM my_table
)
DELETE FROM duplicate
WHERE row_num > 1;






Q.5 
TABLE A
A_ID 
B_ID


TABLE B
B_ID
A_ID


SHOULD WE CREATE TABLE LIKE THIS IF WE CAN THAN HOW CAN WE DO IT?


Yes, it is possible to create two tables in SQL where the primary key of one table is a foreign key in the second table, and vice versa. This is called a circular or reciprocal relationship. However, it is not a recommended practice as it can lead to data integrity issues and also be difficult to query.


A circular relationship between tables can lead to data integrity issues because it creates a dependency between the two tables. If a row in one table is deleted or updated, it can affect the data in the other table and cause inconsistencies.






Q.6 TRIGGER FOR DELETE EMPLOYEE AND ALSO DELETE ALL RELATED DATA FROM OTHER TABLES.


CREATE TRIGGER remove_employee
AFTER DELETE ON employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
DELETE FROM leave WHERE emp_id=old.emp_id
DELETE FROM projects WHERE emp_id=old.emp_id
DELETE FROM holiday WHERE emp_id=old.emp_id
DELETE FROM salary WHERE emp_id=old.emp_id
END;
